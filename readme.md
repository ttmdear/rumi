# rumi
In short, the library supports the Active Record. The current version is
supported only Mysql database, but in the future I would like to introduce
support for other databases.  But also for RestApi, FileSystem, Soap etc.

The second flagship aim is to adhere to the principle of "KISS", ie Keep it
simple stupid. The library is to be simple for developers, and efficient.

Feel free to join the project.

To install

    composer require ttmdear/rumi
